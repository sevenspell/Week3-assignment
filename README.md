Title: Week3-assignment utilizing javascript

This project is the first time I'm applying my one-week knowledge (plus A LOT of online research) of Javascript. It focuses on using Javascript to build a series of actions and logic that generates a random password based on user choices. It is a baby step towards honing my Javascript skills, and I learnt:

1) Javascript syntax;
2) The building blocks of JS - variables, functions, console log, loops, onclick events, math.floor/random calculations, etc;
3)  Logical thinking - how the JS codes can be sequenced to make it work the way I want it to.


## Installation

VSCode, GitBash, Github and Slack (which was basically used to seek help!) were the fundamental blocks to complete this project.

VSCode - used for actual coding
GitBash - used to push code onto Github
Github - used as a repository for this project's codes
Slack - communication tool with my fellow classmates and the teaching team
